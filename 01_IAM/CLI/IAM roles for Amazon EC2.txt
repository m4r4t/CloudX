1.  Create an IAM role.
2.  Define which accounts or AWS services can assume the role.
3.  Define which API actions and resources the application can use after assuming the role.
4.  Specify the role when you launch your instance, or attach the role to an existing instance.
5.  Have the application retrieve a set of temporary credentials and use them.

Instance profiles
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Amazon EC2 uses an instance profile as a container for an IAM role. When you create an IAM role using the IAM console, 
the console creates an instance profile automatically and gives it the same name as the role to which it corresponds. If you use 
the Amazon EC2 console to launch an instance with an IAM role or to attach an IAM role to an instance, you choose the role based on a 
list of instance profile names.

If you use the AWS CLI, API, or an AWS SDK to create a role, you create the role and instance profile as separate actions, with potentially 
different names. If you then use the AWS CLI, API, or an AWS SDK to launch an instance with an IAM role or to attach an IAM role to an 
instance, specify the instance profile name.

An instance profile can contain only one IAM role. This limit cannot be increased.

Grant an IAM user permission to pass an IAM role to an instance
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
To enable an IAM user to launch an instance with an IAM role or to attach or replace an IAM role for an existing instance, you must 
grant the user permission to use the following API actions:

- iam:PassRole
- ec2:AssociateIamInstanceProfile
- ec2:ReplaceIamInstanceProfileAssociation

For example, the following IAM policy grants users permission to launch instances with an IAM role, or to attach or replace an IAM role
for an existing instance using the AWS CLI.
